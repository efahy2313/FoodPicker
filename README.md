This project is nothing crazy and is very simple, it is just me wanting to apply my skill set I have learned towards something that will make my life easier! A list of restaurants will be held in a list. The program will randomly pick one restaurant out of the list. If the user does not want the restaurant that was picked they can request another one. If the user does not want a restaurant it will be removed from the list.
